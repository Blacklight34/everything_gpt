This is a web-based chat application that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user messages. The application is built using ReactJS, and communicates with the OpenAI API using the `openai` npm package.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository using git clone `https://github.com/Blacklight34/everything_gpt.git`
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Create a .env file in the root directory with your OpenAI API key. The file should contain the following line: `REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`
4. Start the development server using `npm start`

# Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the chat application by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

To start a conversation, simply type a message in the input field at the bottom of the screen and press enter. The application will send your message to the OpenAI API, which will generate a response. The response will be displayed in the chat window, and you can continue the conversation by typing another message.

# Deployment - `npm run build`
